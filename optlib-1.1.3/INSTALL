The standard method of compiling and installing is to use cmake.

Typical installation will include

     mkdir build
     cd build
     ccmake ..

        (fill in options you want)
  
     make
     make install

which will install include files and the libopt.a archive, as well as the
ol_serial_driver test program.

As of version 1.1.0, the MPI stuff from 1.0 is still in the code, but
I've not implemented it in the move to a single "optlib" frontend yet.
